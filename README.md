# tainake is a fun app which works both as site and extention for chrome based browsers.

IDK why i made this but it is what it is i guess.

If you want to use this as a chrome extention just download this repo as a zip folder, extract it. Go to extention menu of chrome. turn on developer mode and click on load unpacked.
Show the root folder and you should be done.

have fun ig
